# For GeoPandas, it's often better to let its dependencies resolve naturally,
# but pinning can help if there are issues.
# Fiona often requires specific GDAL versions to be present on the system.
# Installing geopandas will pull fiona, shapely, pyproj.
geopandas==0.13.2 # This version is relatively recent and stable
plotly==5.18.0
# shapely (will be pulled by geopandas)
# fiona (will be pulled by geopandas)
# pyproj (will be pulled by geopandas)

# Optional, but sometimes useful for GDAL context if pip installs have issues:
# rasterio
# shapely # often a dependency of geopandas, good to list explicitly
# requests # If any external API calls were planned
# openpyxl # If reading/writing Excel files
# prophet # If actual Prophet forecasting was used
# statsmodels # If ARIMA or other stat models were used
