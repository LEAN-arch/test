streamlit==1.30.0  # Or a recent stable version
pandas==2.0.3     # Or a recent stable 2.x version, or a late 1.5.x
numpy==1.24.3     # A version known to work well with pandas 2.0.x
geopandas==0.13.2 # Or a recent stable version
plotly==5.18.0    # Or a recent stable version
shapely~=2.0.1    # Often a dependency for geopandas, good to specify
Fiona==1.9.4
matplotlib>=3.7.0 # Add matplotlib, specify a version or range

# For GeoPandas, it's often better to let its dependencies resolve naturally,
# but pinning can help if there are issues.
# Fiona often requires specific GDAL versions to be present on the system.
# Installing geopandas will pull fiona, shapely, pyproj.
geopandas==0.13.2 # This version is relatively recent and stable
plotly==5.18.0
# shapely (will be pulled by geopandas)
# fiona (will be pulled by geopandas)
# pyproj (will be pulled by geopandas)

# Optional, but sometimes useful for GDAL context if pip installs have issues:
# rasterio
